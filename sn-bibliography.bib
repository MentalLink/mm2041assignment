    abstract = "{This research was started in 2019 for the 500th anniversary of Leonardo da Vinci's death. Our Italian-French research group focused its attention on a famous drawing by da Vinci in which a water jet impacts on a pool (RCIN 912660 The Windsor Collection). This particular drawing has often been used by many fluid dynamicists as the first important document concerning turbulent flows. It is worth noting that the word “turbulence,” one of the most important phenomena in fluid dynamics, was used for the first time by da Vinci in the “Atlantic codex.” After a detailed study of different historical documents, we sought to reproduce the flow drawn in the sheet RCIN 912660 using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics model in order to better analyze the different descriptions that Leonardo reported beside his drawing.}",

  abstract  = "Based on Newton's third law of motion, we present a different
               but quite general analysis of Archimedes' principle. This
               analysis explains the reduction in apparent weight of a
               submerged object in all cases, regardless of its position in the
               fluid. We also study the case in which the object rests on the
               bottom of the container where the net hydrostatic force on it is
               downward, and explain where in this case the reduction in the
               apparent weight comes from.",
